Here goes nothin'!

It's about time I get back into the swing of coding and design. It was my initial passion, after all. But long gone are the days of frames vs. HTML splash screens. Even Wordpress development is starting to feel a bit dated. But hey, I've always been old-school. So as tools and platforms come and go, I stick to my trusty Notepad. (Though these days it seems like there's always a newer, better "version" of Notepad out there that "everyone's using". I'm not against these things, as I know they're meant to speed up productivity and reduce errors, but nothing beats good old self-review, am I right?)
